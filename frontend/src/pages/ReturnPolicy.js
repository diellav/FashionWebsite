        <p>At UrbanGaze, your satisfaction is at the core of everything we do. We want you to love every piece you order, but we understand that sometimes things don’t work out as expected. That’s why we’ve created a return policy that’s as smooth and customer-friendly as our shopping experience.</p>
        <p>You can return any unused, unworn, and unwashed item within <strong>14 days</strong> of delivery for a full refund or exchange. All returned products must be in their original packaging, with tags attached. Items marked as final sale, intimate wear, and personalized items are unfortunately not eligible for return or exchange unless they arrive damaged or defective.</p>
        <p>To initiate a return, simply contact our support team through your account or email us at <strong>support@urbangaze.com</strong>. We'll provide you with a return label and guide you through the process. Please allow 3–5 business days after we receive your return for your refund to be processed back to your original payment method.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to make returns hassle-free, because we believe style should come with confidence — and that includes the confidence of knowing we’ve got your back.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about your return or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help, every step of the way.</p>
